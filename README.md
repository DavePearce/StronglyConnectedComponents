# StronglyConnectedComponents

Two example implementations of my algorithm for finding strongly connected components in a directed graph.  This algorithm improves the space requirements of Tarjan's by compressing two arrays into one.  See the following paper for details of how the algorithm works:

Both a recursive and imperative version of this algorithm are given for completeness.
